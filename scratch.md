The students of today are the engineers of tomorrow (You can say it in a better way)

- Talk about the inequality in early age education.
From unicef (https://www.unicef.org/mali/en/education):
""
Although education in Mali has been improving over the last decade, more than two million children aged between 5 to 17 still do not go to school, and over half of Mali’s young people aged 15 to 24 are not literate. Household poverty, child labour, child marriage, insecurity and a lack of schools close to children’s homes are all factors driving the high drop out and out-of-school rate in Mali. Among children that do attend school, the absence of qualified teachers, text books and low-quality school environment all adversely affect learning outcomes: the vast majority of students in fifth grade in Mali are not able to master basic mathematics and reading skills.

Access to and completion of schooling is inequitable, with girls and children from the poorest families at highest risk of school dropout: only 73.8 per cent of girls are enrolled in primary basic education, compared with 85.8 per cent of boys. By the time they reach secondary education, the proportion of girls enrolled is only 15 per cent, compared with 21 per cent of boys.

- Less fortunate families can't afford a private tutor to their children to reinforce their math skill
- Our goal for 2024 is to help 5000 primary students to develop basic numerical skills by providing them with math books and private tutors and mentors

- Our goal spans not only primary school but also junior high and high school. We ignite in students the love of science by implementing educational programs that foster curiosity. Coding camps for high schoolers, Open Science Day (that reunite the students) and they engage in games, creative thinking, puzzles, problem solving.
